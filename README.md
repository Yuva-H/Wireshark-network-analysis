# Wireshark Network Analysis and Troubleshooting

This project demonstrates the use of *Wireshark*, a powerful network protocol analyzer, to inspect live traffic, identify issues, and understand how protocols work.

## 🔍 Project Overview
- *Tool Used:* Wireshark
- *Date:* June 2025
- *Environment:* Local Lab Setup
- *Objective:* Capture and analyze network packets for learning and security awareness

## 🛠 Key Features Used
- Live packet capturing (Ethernet/Wi-Fi)
- Protocol filtering (e.g., HTTP, IP, TCP)
- Packet inspection (headers, payloads)
- Stream reassembly (TCP sessions)
- Offline .pcap file analysis
- Statistics and protocol hierarchy tools

## 📘 Use Cases Demonstrated
- Basic web browsing capture (HTTP filter)
- IP-based filtering to monitor specific devices
- TCP handshake observation
- Identifying unencrypted data in packets

## 📁 Files Included
- Wireshark_Project_Report.docx — Full written report with analysis
- capture.pcap (optional, add only if <25MB)
- screenshots/ folder (if screenshots are used)

## ✅ Conclusion
Wireshark is a vital tool for network troubleshooting, protocol learning, and security analysis. This project offers hands-on experience in analyzing real-time traffic and applying it in cybersecurity contexts.
